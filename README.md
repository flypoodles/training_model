1. clone the repository into Intelliji IDE
2. On the terminal, run sbt.
3. run reload and then assembly inside the sbt shell
4. sbt assembly will produce the jar file called "cs441hw2.jar" which located at "target/scala-2.12/cs441hw2.jar"
5. create an empty directory and copy the jar file to that directory, so you can have a clean state to run the jar file.
